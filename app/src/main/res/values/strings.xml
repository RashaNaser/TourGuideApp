    <string name="about_gaza">Gazaâ€™s position on the crossroads between Asia and Africa has ensured it a history as troubled as it is long. Since the Canaanite period, it has been fought over, invaded, and occupied by nearly all the powers that have marched across the Middle East. In spite of this turbulent history, Gaza boasts some of the most beautiful beaches in the world and friendly and inviting locals. Although the population is predominantly Muslim, Gaza has a wonderful diversity of historical and cultural sites, from beautiful ornate mosques to ancient churches and a history predating the monotheistic, Abrahamic religions.</string>
